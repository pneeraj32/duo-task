# Duo Task

This is a basic Flask application that serves a simple static website that returns the machine's hostname.

It is directly accessible on port `5500`.

Set the environment variable `YOUR_NAME` to your name to have the app display your name in its welcome message. Otherwise, it will refer to you as "friend".
